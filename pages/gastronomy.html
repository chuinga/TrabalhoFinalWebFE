          <p class="mainText">
            The intense fishing activity that exists in Setúbal means that the
            typical dishes of this region are made with fish and seafood. In the
            parish of Sado, the river and its entire estuary are very rich in
            fish, serving as a breeding ground for many species. This richness
            enhances our cuisine, with the following typical dishes being
            highlighted: Eel stew; fried eels; fried Choco; seafood rice;
            Setubalense stew and several dishes made with grilled fish, in which
            sardines deserve a prominent place.

          <p class="mainText">
            Roasted fish is one of the biggest highlights of the Setúbal region.
            Directly from the fish markets of Setúbal and Sesimbra, it is
            characterized by its unique freshness. Sardines, horse mackerel, red
            mullet, charroco, alcorrazes, purple duck, chaputa, safio, ray or
            tremelga are examples of fish typical of the Sadina coast.
            Traditionally, the fish is accompanied with boiled potatoes, salad
            and, in some cases, crumbs.

          <h1>Wine & Cheese</h1>
          <p class="mainText">
            Wine and cheese are the quintessence of pairing. If it is clear for
            red wines and, more recently, white wines, this harmonization with
            Moscatel de Setúbal is no longer so clear and consensual. There are
            many theories and disagreements, but respecting the basic principles
            of harmonization, this will always be a harmonization by contrast,
            based on the acidic capacity of Moscatel de Setúbal, as a
            “butchering” element of the cheese’s fat and sweetness versus the
            salt contained. in cheese. Taking a chance on the best type of
            cheese to pair with Moscatel de Setúbal would be the saltiest and
            most mature. A good example is Azeitão cheese, produced in the same
            region.

          <h1>Moscatel</h1>
          <p class="mainText">
            Moscatel de Setúbal is a Portuguese muscatel produced around the
            Setúbal Municipality on the Península de Setúbal. The region is
            known primarily for its fortified Muscat wines known as Moscatel de
            Setúbal. The style was believed to have been invented by José Maria
            da Fonseca, the founder of José Maria da Fonseca, the oldest
            industrial-scale table wine producer in Portugal dating back to
            1834. J.M. Fonseca company still holds a quasi-monopoly control over
            the production of Moscatel de Setúbal today
