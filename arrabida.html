        <h2>Setúbal</h2>
        <p>
          In my humble opinion, Setúbal has three major attractions: Arrábida,
          Beaches and gastronomy, apart from my memories, family and friends...

        <p>
          Setúbal is a city in Portugal, located in the Setúbal Peninsula, in
          the Lisbon metropolitan area. It is also the seat of the Setúbal
          District and the main city of the Setúbal Municipality. Setúbal was
          ranked the 11th most livable city in Portugal in 2018.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          Setúbal was founded in the first millennium BC by the Phoenicians, who
          created a commercial outpost there. It was then conquered by the
          Carthaginians, and then by the Romans, who established a fish salting
          factory there. The Moors conquered the city in the 8th century, and it
          was then taken by the Portuguese in the 12th century.
