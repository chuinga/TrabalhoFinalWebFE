        <h2>Setúbal</h2>
        <p>
          In my humble opinion, Setúbal has three major attractions: Arrábida,
          Beaches and gastronomy, apart from my memories, family and friends...

          Setúbal is a city in Portugal, situated on the Setúbal Peninsula
          within the Lisbon metropolitan area. It serves as the administrative
          center of the Setúbal District and is the principal city of the
          Setúbal Municipality. In 2018, Setúbal was ranked as the 11th most
          livable city in Portugal.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          Setúbal was founded in the first millennium BC by the Phoenicians, who
          established a commercial outpost. It was later conquered by the
          Carthaginians, followed by the Romans, who set up a fish salting
          factory. In the 8th century, the city was taken by the Moors, and it
          was eventually recaptured by the Portuguese in the 12th century.

        <p>
          Setúbal is situated on the Setúbal Peninsula, nestled between the Sado
          and Tejo rivers. The city is encircled by the Arrábida Natural Park,
          renowned for its stunning beaches and mountains. Additionally, it is

          of bird and fish species.
